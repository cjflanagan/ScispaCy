The most common mutations, Tyr537Ser (Y537S) and Asp538Gly (D538G), are detected in ~ 30% of endocrine resistant metastatic breast cancer patients. These ESR1 mutations induce the agonist conformation of ERalpha, confer an estrogen-independent phenotype, and promote drug resistance to antiestrogens. METHODS: ER-positive, estrogen-dependent MCF-7 cells were engineered to express either the Y537S or D538G mutants using CRISPR knock-in (cY537S and cD538G). These cells were used to screen several estrogen receptor degrader (ERD) compounds synthesized using the Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTAC) method to induce degradation of ERalpha via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. RESULTS: Wild-type MCF-7 and ERalpha LBD mutant cells were treated with ERD-148 (10 pM-1 microM) and assayed for cellular proliferation using the PrestoBlue cell viability assay. ERD-148 attenuated ER-dependent growth with IC50 values of 0.8, 10.5, and 6.1 nM in MCF-7, cY537S, and cD538G cells, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that MCF-7 cells treated with 1 nM ERD-148 for 24 h exhibited reduced ERalpha protein expression as compared to the mutants. The ER-regulated gene, GREB1, demonstrated significant downregulation in parental and mutant cells after 24 h of ERD-148 treatment at 10 nM. Growth of the ER-negative, estrogen-independent MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was not inhibited by ERD-148 at the ~ IC90 observed in the ER-positive cells. CONCLUSION: ERD-148 inhibits the growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells via downregulating ERalpha with comparable potency to Fulvestrant with marginal non-specific toxicity\"\"\""
